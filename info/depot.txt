* Depot *
File module

 - Generic
 Includes common functions such as loading and saving text or binary files.
  
 
 
* Depot/SFML *

 - ResourceManagerBasic
 A basic resource manager that stores fonts, graphics and sounds. Uses IndexedMap, which allows access to resources via indices or string key. Uses Plinth.
 
 

A note about namespaces:
All of Depot's functions/classes are in the "hx" namespace and under the sub-namespace "Depot" (hx::Depot).
Functions/classes in Depot/SFML are in the "hx" namespace and under the sub-namespaces "Sfml" and "Depot" (hx::Depot::Sfml).
 
Depot has two lists of inclusions: <Hx/Depot/standard.hpp> and <Hx/Depot/sfml.hpp>.
<Hx/Depot/all.hpp> includes both of these lists.
<Hx/Depot.hpp> simply includes <Hx/Depot/all.hpp>

Depot "standard" list (<Hx/Plinth/standard.hpp>) has no external dependencies.
Depot "sfml" list (<Hx/Depot/sfml.hpp>) requires Plinth and SFML library (sfml-dev.org). Minimum SFML version is 2.0. Recommended 2.2+.
Including <Hx/Depot.hpp> or <Hx/Depot/all.hpp> includes both of these lists so also requires SFML library.
